# SiteSeer

My bot to track changes in websites. Deployed at t.me/siteseer_bot .

## Usecases

> For students

* Track exam form website
* Track student result website

> For devs

* Track pull requests page
* Update when an issue gets updated

## Commands

/start to get list of commands
/watch {sitename} to track a website
/unsub {sitename} to unsubscribe from a website
/list to get list of websites

## Components of the Bot

1. The actual bot, which accepts regex and gives output.
2. The site change checker, which converts the HTML of the site to a checksum and compares with prev checksum.
3. A cronjob which runs the site change function every 15 minutes.

## Tasklist

- [ ] Compare a screenshot of the website instead of complete HTML
- [ ] Use JSSoup instead ?
- [ ] Send image with change notification, so user doesn't have to open site
- [ ] Split code into multiple files, abstract mongo, telegram
